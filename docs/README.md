# Documentation for PowerModelsGMD.jl

Building the documentation for PMsGMD is done with [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl).

To preview the HTML output, run the following command:
```julia
julia --color=yes make.jl
```
After that documents can be viewed in `build/index.html`.

**Warning**: Do not `git commit` the contents of the build (or any other content generated by Documenter) to your repository's master branch. This helps to avoid including unnessesary changes for anyone reviewing commits that happen to include documentation changes.

For further details, please refer to the [Documentation](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/) of Documenter.
